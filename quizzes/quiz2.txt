Quiz #2

Q: How do you scale an object relative to it's own origin?
A: The scale operation usually acts relative to the world origin, we need to translate the object to the world origin, apply the scale operation and then translate it back to it's position.

Q: How do you define the camera's position?
A: OpenGL provides a function called lookAt which takes 3 parameters: The position of the camera, the target or center of the view and the up direction.

Q: How do you find the center of a set of points?
A: Loop throught the points and get the min and max value for each coordinate x, y and z. Take the average of the two points and you get the center.

Q: How do you translate an object?
A: Loop through each point and add the translate vector.

Q: How do you rotate a point?
A: GLM has a rotate function which takes as parameters a model, an angle in radians and the rotation axis. You can translate the object to origin to apply the rotation and then bring it back.

Q: How do you scale an object?
A: Loop through each point and multiply by the scale factor in x, y and z.

Q: How do I define the geometry of my object?
A: The geometry is usually defined in triangles. With OpenGL we can use Immediate Mode where we call functions to draw each vertex. Or we can use the Vertex Buffer Object where we have an array of vertices and an array of indices to specify the order on which we draw the vertices. You should render your triangles in clockwise order for them to be visible or counter-clockwise for them to be hidden. We can also define normals, colors and texture coordinates.
