Consciousness is one of the key elements that make us special. We have the ability to be aware of our mental activity, emotional state and external environment.

The two main dimensions of consciousness are wakefulness and awareness. Some people report experiences of lucid dreaming in which they are not awake but they’re aware.

Sometimes we get so involved in an activity that we lose track of time. Some people have a heightened sense of attention and this can be practiced with mindfulness techniques.

There are two types of attention: selective and sustained. Inattentional blindness is when we are focused on one thing and don’t notice something. The cocktail party effect is when you notice a specific phrase or word in the background noise even if you weren’t paying attention. Change blindness happens when we are focused and don’t notice changes in the environment.

The need to sleep is a result of biological processes called circadian rhythms that occur every 24 hours. Some people wake up early and others stay awake at night. Sleep helps our bodies restore energy, consolidate memories and learn.

People who had psychedelic experiences report feelings of transcendence, unity, positive mood, universal love and interconnectedness.

Effective teams usually practice a form of shared consciousness and they have the ability to read, antecipate and non-verbally communicate.
