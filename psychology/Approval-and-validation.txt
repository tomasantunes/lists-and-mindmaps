We’re constantly seeking approval and validation. Humans just want to fit in and be accepted. We fear criticism and rejection and crave validation.

Validation is the process where we confirm or verify validity and approval is an expression of agreement, permission or acknowledgement.

Sometimes we can’t trust ourselves to make our own judgements and we need others to validate our beliefs. People who are highly self-conscious tend to be more sensitive to this issue.

Your life shouldn’t depend on other people’s opinions. There’s no reason to care about those who wouldn’t do the same for you. It’s a symptom of low self-esteem.

When we get bad experiences with people’s reaction and give too much importance to validation we don’t take as many risks. It’s ok to make mistakes, you should take more chances and ask more questions.

You need to have enough self-awareness and notice which behaviors and choices make you feel good. Be honest and take time to evaluate your decisions.

Approval seekers change their minds easily when they meet resistance, they are insincere, they get upset about feedback and they are afraid to say no.

It’s tempting to take the easy out and stop caring. You have to be clear about what’s necessary important to you so you can eliminate the stress and work on your personal growth.
