Creativity promotes thinking outside the box and problem solving. It is a pre-requisite for innovation.

Breaking out of traditional analytical methods involves risk-taking and iteration. New ideas result from the association of old elements in new combinations.

Processing incomplete information can be accelerated by forming new links on the data available.

Keeping an open mind is essential to expand our knowledge. Current rules and constraints are not rigid and can be adapted to our needs if we have new information.

Problem solving is usally a stage process that starts with an insight, it goes through research and then there is an “aha” moment when creativity and logic come together which we call illumination. The next step is performing verification to test our hypothesis.

This process can be enhanced by improvements in our learning experience with emotional and social development.
