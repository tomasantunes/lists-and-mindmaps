It’s time to stop waiting for distant goals in the future and start enjoying your life today.

The past and the future are projections of our mind, everything happens in the present moment.

The way our brain works our memories change every time we recall them. As time passes what you remember is different from what actually happened. Let go of the past and do better today.

The future could be either good or bad. When the future is good you feel hope and anticipation, when it’s bad you feel anxiety. To create a better future you have to do well today.

Sometimes we seek pleasures like sex, drugs and traveling. Those who have it suffer because they have it and those who don’t have suffer because they don’t have it. Real happiness depends on your perception of the world and your reality. Avoid addictive behaviors and take pleasure in the small things of everyday life.

Practice gratitude regularly. It helps you remember the good things in your life and be more receptive to good experiences. Be grateful for the little things like a cup of coffee, taking a walk or a phone call to a loved one.

Think positive, be affirmative. Repetition is key to building good habits. It’s better to think of the things you can do than the things can’t do.
Make time for yourself, don’t wait until tomorrow. Take some time to read a book, listen to music, exercise or practice your favorite hobbies. Being productive makes you feel good, especially if you work on things that give you purpose.

Don’t wait for other people’s validation. You should be happy regardless of forces outside your control. Celebrate your achievements and the journey that led you to the present moment.
