Acceptance is key to improve your mental health. Sometimes we have difficulty accepting something and then we end up finding a way.

If you don’t accept who you are you will always feel conflicted and have trouble with self-esteem.

We invest so much hope and energy to our goals that when our expectations are not met we find the outcomes hard to accept.

If you could stop complaining, judging and trying to change other people you could just live your life day by day without any stress.

Non-acceptance is a one-way ticket to anxiety, anger and unhappiness. It’s a form of denial and insanity.

So many times we want to be productive and change our lives but we are our own worst critic and our path is full of resistance because of our expectations. Resistance can be based on fears we have that are mostly unfounded.

If we allow this fear to grow we may become shut down and postpone taking an action indefinitely, leading to lower confidence.

When we accept things as they and we are aware of the limits it’s easier to take action or seek the help we need.

Acceptance is different from tolerance. It doesn’t mean we accept bad behavior or injustice.

We should let go of our negative emotions and try to overcome them. Things that seem important today will be gone tomorrow, there’s no point in worrying so much about them.
